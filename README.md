`dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=64K conv=noerror,sync`

##Â not tested

add a "bs=100M conv=notrunc" and it's much faster in my experience.

## not tested

dd if=/dev/sda | pv -c | gzip | ssh user@backupserver "split -b 2048m -d - backup-`hostname -s`.img.gz"

Nobody seems to know this trick... dd is an asymmetrical copying program, meaning it will read first, then write, then back. You can pipe dd to itself and force it to perform the copy symmetrically, like this: dd if=/dev/sda | dd of=/dev/sdb. In my tests, running the command without the pipe gave me a throughput of ~112kb/s. With the pipe, I got ~235kb/s. I've never experienced any issues with this method.
